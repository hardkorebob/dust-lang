# dust-lang
Dust is everywhere. Dust is old but wise. Dust doesn't rust. Dust offers a return to the source. Dust is everywhere. Dust is not something that just settles on things; it is the fundamental material of things. It is ancient, ubiquitous, and enduring. It does not decay. It is the foundation. Build with what lasts. Build with Dust.
